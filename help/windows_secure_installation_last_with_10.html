<p class="sectionTitle"><a id="toc1"></a>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</p>

<div class="section">

	<p>Some Windows vulnerabilities can be exploited without user interaction as soon as the computer is placed online. Therefore, after performing a clean installation of Windows, it is necessary to resolve the known examples of these vulnerabilities before placing the computer online, including before running Windows Update.</p>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_1"></a>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Vulnerabilities And Worms</p>

	<p>Windows vulnerabilities are flaws in the Windows operating system code that render Windows susceptible to exploitation. The successful exploitation of a Windows vulnerability results in compromise.<!-- Need to define  compromise. --> Toward securing Windows, it is instructive to divide Windows vulnerabilities into two groups: 1.) those that require user interaction to be exploited, and 2.) those that do not require user interaction to be exploited.</p>

	<p>For the Windows vulnerabilities that require user interaction to be exploited, compromise requires user interaction on the computer besides placing the vulnerable computer online (i.e., connecting the computer to a network, be it an Intranet and/or the Internet). User interactions that can result in compromise, known as triggers, include attaching external/removable drives or network devices, visiting Web sites, accessing/receiving/opening emails, opening email attachments, creating/accessing/opening/installing/joining/connecting to network resources including but not limited to servers/domains/devices/shares/files/etc. In other words, for the Windows vulnerabilities that require user interaction to be exploited, in the absence of the appropriate user interaction required to trigger exploitation, compromise cannot occur simply by placing the vulnerable computer online.</p>

	<p>For the Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited, compromise does not require any user interaction on the computer besides placing the vulnerable computer online. In other words, for the Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited, there is no trigger and compromise can occur simply by placing the vulnerable computer online.</p>

	<p>After installing Windows 10/11, a common practice is to place the computer online and run Windows Update to install the latest Cumulative Update for Windows 10/11. Although the intention (to secure Windows) is good, this practice is bad. Why? Because, for the Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited, compromise can occur simply by placing the vulnerable computer online, and this includes during the time that Windows Update is running.</p>

	<p>Worms are the class of threat that automatically run themselves on, and automatically copy themselves from, computer to computer over a network without user interaction. To accomplishes this, worms exploit vulnerabilities that, themselves, do not require user interaction to be exploited and that allow remote code execution (RCE). First, the worm exploits the vulnerability, then it runs itself on the now compromised computer, including possibly delivering a destructive payload, and then it attempts to propagate itself to other vulnerable computers on the network, again without user interaction.</p>

	<p>Worms are extremely dangerous because they can automatically infect a tremendous number of vulnerable networked computers seemingly simultaneously without any user interaction besides placing the vulnerable computers online. Infamous worms that exploit Windows vulnerabilities include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Blaster: Discovered 11 Aug 2003. Affects Windows 2000/XP. Resolved by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2003/ms03-026" class="linkContent">MS03-026 (learn.microsoft.com)</a> published 16 Jul 2003.</li>

Resolved by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2003/ms03-007" class="linkContent">MS03-007 (learn.microsoft.com)</a> published 17 Mar 2003 and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2003/ms03-026" class="linkContent">MS03-026 (docs.microsoft.com)</a> published 16 Jul 2003.</li>
		<li>Sasser: Discovered 30 Apr 2004. Affects Windows 2000/XP. Resolved by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2004/ms04-011" class="linkContent">MS04-011 (learn.microsoft.com)</a> published 13 Apr 2004.</li>
		<li>Conficker (a.k.a., Downadup): Discovered 21 Aug 2008. Affects Windows 2000/XP/Vista. Resolved by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-067" class="linkContent">MS08-067 (learn.microsoft.com)</a> published 23 Oct 2008.</li>
		<li>Wannacry: Discovered 12 May 2017. Affects Windows Vista/7/8.1/10. Resolved by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010" class="linkContent">MS17-010 (learn.microsoft.com)</a> published 14 Mar 2017.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Worms Blaster, Welchia, Sasser, Conficker, and Wannacry remain so prevalent that even today - years after they have been discovered - vulnerable Windows computers are still being compromised by these worms as soon as they are placed online, including during the time that Windows Update is running.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, most of the Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited are not wormable (i.e., do not allow RCE and, therefore, are not suitable for worms). Instead, the impact of most Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited is to allow either denial of service, elevation of privilege (EOP), information disclosure, security feature bypass, or spoofing. However, wormable Windows vulnerabilities are found every year. For example, <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21907" class="linkContent">CVE-2022-21907 (cve.mitre.org)</a>, released in Jan 2022, describes a wormable Windows 10/11 vulnerability. Whether or not a worm will be developed to exploit this vulnerability only time will tell.</p>

	<p>The exploitability (i.e., the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited) of a Windows vulnerability that does not require user interaction to be exploited depends on the computer's network environment. For a computer that is directly connected to the Internet (i.e., for a computer that is assigned a public IP address because it is not behind a gateway/router), the exploitability of a Windows vulnerability that does not require user interaction to be exploited is high. For a computer that is connected to a local network (i.e., for a computer that is assigned a private IP address because it is behind a gateway/router), the exploitability of a Windows vulnerability that does not require user interaction to be exploited is relatively low. Note, however, that some worms (e.g., Downadup (a.k.a., Conficker)) can transfer across (i.e., bridge) gateways/routers. Hence, rather than trying to take network environment, exploitability, severity rating, impact, and other factors into account, thereby, driving oneself mad in the process, a simpler and safer policy has been adopted for this web page: to secure a clean installation of Windows, it is necessary to resolve <em>all</em> known Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited before placing the computer online, not after placing the computer online.</p>

					<li>In this web page the severity rating (e.g., low, moderate, important, and critical) and impact (e.g., denial of service, EOP, information disclosure, RCE, security feature bypass, or spoofing) of a Windows vulnerability does not matter. The only thing that matters is whether or not the Windows vulnerability requires user interaction to be exploited.</li>
					<li>Toward securing a clean installation of Windows, this Web page assumes the worse, including:
						<ul>
							<li>The network administrator and/or Internet Service Provider is not filtering, or is doing a poor job of filtering, malicious network traffic.</li>
							<li>A gateway/router is not being used, or, if a gateway/router is being used, it is running outdated, insecure firmware and/or is not properly configured.</li>
							<li>If a gateway/router is being used, it is not explicitly configured to block worms that can transfer across (i.e., bridge) gateways/routers.</li>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_2"></a>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 10/11 Servicing Model: Cumulative Updates</p>

	<p>From 2015 to 2021 Microsoft released a new version (a.k.a., Feature Update) of Windows 10 twice a year, the first in the spring and the second in the fall. Starting in November 2021, Microsoft intended to release a new version of Windows 10/11 once a year, in the second half of the year. However, in April 2023 Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-client-roadmap-update/ba-p/3805227" class="linkContent">announced (techcommunity.microsoft.com)</a> that Windows 10 Version 22H2 is the final version of Windows 10.</p>

	<p>On the second Tuesday of each month, Microsoft releases a Cumulative Update (a.k.a., Quality Update) for the supported versions of Windows 10/11. Microsoft supported each version of Windows 10 Home and Pro through Windows 10 Version 21H2 with Cumulative Updates for 18 months. Microsoft intends to support Windows 10 Version 22H2 Home and Pro with Cumulative Updates through October 14, 2025. Microsoft intends to support each version of Windows 11 Home and Pro with Cumulative Updates for 24 months:</p>

	<p>In the Windows 10/11 servicing model, a Cumulative Update for Windows 10/11 is a single file that contains new security and non-security fixes, and all previous security and non-security fixes (if there are any), for a version of Windows 10/11. In other words, in the Windows 10/11 servicing model, Cumulative Updates for Windows 10/11 are cumulative back through the initial release of the version of Windows 10/11. This means that to obtain the security (and non-security) fixes for Windows 10/11 from the initial release of the version of Windows 10/11 through the present, it is only necessary to install the latest Cumulative Update (LCU) for Windows 10/11 for the supported version of Windows 10/11.</p>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_3"></a>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Servicing Stack Updates</p>

	<p>Servicing is the process of installing a Cumulative Update, Security Update, Update, fix, component, role, etc. Depending on what is being installed, servicing is performed manually by the user and/or automatically by Windows Update. The Servicing Stack is the component of Windows that performs servicing. Like other Windows components, the Servicing Stack is periodically updated. A Servicing Stack Update (SSU) improves the speed and reliability of servicing.</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_3_1"></a>1.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting March 2021, Servicing Stack Updates For Windows 10 Version 2004 And Newer Are Included In The Cumulative Updates For Windows 10 Version 2004 And Newer</p>

	<p>Starting in March 2021, the Servicing Stack Updates for Windows 10 Version 2004 and newer are no longer released as standalone Updates. Instead, they are included in the Cumulative Updates for Windows 10 Version 2004 and newer. However, a special Servicing Stack Update for Windows 10 Version 2004, 20H2, and 21H1 (KB5005260) is a prerequisite for installing the latest Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 2004, 20H2, and 21H1. The special Servicing Stack Update Windows 10 Version 2004, 20H2, and 21H1 (KB5005260) is not prerequisite for installing the latest Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 21H2 and newer. Therefore, for Windows 10 Version 21H2 and newer there is no need to worry about Servicing Stack Updates.</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_3_2"></a>1.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Servicing Stack Updates For Windows 11 Are Included In The Cumulative Updates For Windows 11</p>

	<p>The Servicing Stack Updates for Windows 11 are included in the Cumulative Updates for Windows 11. Therefore, for Windows 11 there is no need to worry about Servicing Stack Updates.</p>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_4"></a>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview: How To Secure A Clean Installation Of Windows 10/11</p>

	<p>To secure a clean installation of Windows per this web page, it is necessary to resolve all known Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited before placing the computer online. Rather than read the documentation for the latest Cumulative Update for Windows 10/11 to try to determine if the Cumulative Update resolves any wormable Windows vulnerabilities, it is far simpler to download the latest Cumulative Update for Windows 10/11, to copy the Cumulative Update to removable media, and to install the Cumulative Update before placing the computer online. Accordingly, the following is an overview of how to secure a clean installation of Windows 10/11 per this web page.</p>

		<div class="note">

	<ul>
		<li>Do the following offline, and before interacting with the computer in any way that could result in compromise:
			<ol>
				<li>Perform a default installation of a supported version of Windows 10/11 onto a new or fully erased hard drive. The new or fully erased hard drive ensures the installation of the supported version of Windows 10/11 is free from compromise (i.e., is clean).</li>
				<li>Install the latest Cumulative Update for the supported version of Windows 10/11. This resolves all Windows 10/11 vulnerabilities (that do or do not require user interaction to be exploited) through the present.</li>

<div class="section">

	<p>To secure a clean installation of Windows per this web page, it is necessary to resolve all known Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited before placing the computer online. This requires downloading and copying the latest Cumulative Update for Windows 10/11 to removable media before performing the clean installation of Windows 10/11. Because files on CDs/DVDs are far more difficult manipulate by malicious software/users than files on external hard disk drives and flash memory drives, CDs/DVDs are the removable media of choice.</p>
