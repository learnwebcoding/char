<p class="sectionTitle"><a id="toc1"></a>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</p>

<div class="section">

	<p>Some Windows vulnerabilities can be exploited without user interaction as soon as the computer is placed online. Therefore, after performing a clean installation of Windows, it is necessary to resolve the known examples of these vulnerabilities before placing the computer online, including before running Windows Update or Microsoft Update.</p>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_1"></a>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Vulnerabilities And Worms</p>

	<p>Windows vulnerabilities are flaws in the Windows operating system code that render Windows susceptible to exploitation. The successful exploitation of a Windows vulnerability results in compromise.<!-- Need to define  compromise. --> Toward securing Windows, it is instructive to divide Windows vulnerabilities into two groups: 1.) those that require user interaction to be exploited, and 2.) those that do not require user interaction to be exploited.</p>

	<p>For the Windows vulnerabilities that require user interaction to be exploited, compromise requires user interaction on the computer besides placing the vulnerable computer online (i.e., connecting the computer to a network, be it an Intranet and/or the Internet). User interactions that can result in compromise, known as triggers, include attaching external/removable drives or network devices, visiting Web sites, accessing/receiving/opening emails, opening email attachments, creating/accessing/opening/installing/joining/connecting to network resources including but not limited to servers/domains/devices/shares/files/etc. In other words, for the Windows vulnerabilities that require user interaction to be exploited, in the absence of the appropriate user interaction required to trigger exploitation, compromise cannot occur simply by placing the vulnerable computer online.</p>

	<p>For the Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited, compromise does not require any user interaction on the computer besides placing the vulnerable computer online. In other words, for the Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited, there is no trigger and compromise can occur simply by placing the vulnerable computer online.</p>

	<p>After installing Windows, a common practice is to place the computer online and run Windows Update to install the latest Update (Windows 8.1), Security Monthly Quality Rollup (Windows 8.1), Cumulative Update (Windows 10/11), Security Updates (8.1/10/11), and non-security updates and fixes Windows (8.1/10/11). Although the intension (to secure Windows) is good, this practice is bad. Why? Because, for the Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited, compromise can occur simply by placing the vulnerable computer online, and this includes during the time that Windows Update is running.</p>

	<p>Worms are the class of threat that automatically run themselves on, and automatically copy themselves from, computer to computer over a network without user interaction. To accomplishes this, worms exploit vulnerabilities that, themselves, do not require user interaction to be exploited and that allow remote code execution (RCE). First, the worm exploits the vulnerability, then it runs itself on the now compromised computer, including possibly delivering a destructive payload, and then it attempts to propagate itself to other vulnerable computers on the network, again without user interaction.</p>

	<p>Worms are extremely dangerous because they can automatically infect a tremendous number of vulnerable networked computers seemingly simultaneously without any user interaction besides placing the vulnerable computers online. Infamous worms that exploit Windows vulnerabilities include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Blaster: Discovered 11 Aug 2003. Affects Windows 2000/XP. Resolved by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2003/ms03-026" class="linkContent">MS03-026 (docs.microsoft.com)</a> published 16 Jul 2003.</li>
		<li>Welchia (a.k.a., Nachi): Discovered 18 Aug 2003. Affects Windows 2000/XP. Resolved by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2003/ms03-007" class="linkContent">MS03-007 (docs.microsoft.com)</a> published 17 Mar 2003 and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2003/ms03-026" class="linkContent">MS03-026 (docs.microsoft.com)</a> published 16 Jul 2003.</li>
		<li>Sasser: Discovered 30 Apr 2004. Affects Windows 2000/XP. Resolved by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2004/ms04-011" class="linkContent">MS04-011 (docs.microsoft.com)</a> published 13 Apr 2004.</li>
		<li>Conficker (a.k.a., Downadup): Discovered 21 Aug 2008. Affects Windows 2000/XP/Vista. Resolved by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-067" class="linkContent">MS08-067 (docs.microsoft.com)</a> published 23 Oct 2008.</li>
		<li>Wannacry: Discovered 12 May 2017. Affects Windows Vista/7/8.1/10. Resolved by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010" class="linkContent">MS17-010 (technet.microsoft.com)</a> published 14 Mar 2017.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Worms Blaster, Welchia, Sasser, Conficker, and Wannacry remain so prevalent that even today - years after they have been discovered - vulnerable Windows computers are still being compromised by these worms as soon as they are placed online, including during the time that Windows Update is running.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, most of the Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited are not wormable (i.e., do not allow RCE and, therefore, are not suitable for worms). Instead, the impact of most Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited is to allow either denial of service, elevation of privilege (EOP), information disclosure, security feature bypass, or spoofing. However, wormable Windows vulnerabilities are found every year. For example, <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21907" class="linkContent">CVE-2022-21907 (cve.mitre.org)</a>, released in Jan 2022, describes a wormable Windows 10/11 vulnerability. Whether or not a worm will be developed to exploit this vulnerability is anyone's guess.</p>

	<p>In some environments, the exploitability (i.e., the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited) of a Windows vulnerability that does not require user interaction to be exploited is low. However, in some environments, the exploitability of a Windows vulnerability that does not require user interaction to be exploited is high. In addition, some worms can transfer across gateways/routers. Rather than trying to take environment, exploitability, impact, and other factors into account, and unnecessarily driving oneself mad in the process, a simpler and safer policy has been adopted: to secure a clean installation of Windows per this web page, it is necessary to resolve <em>all</em> known examples of Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited before, not after, placing the computer online.</p>

<!--
Now, someone in the room might say, who cares about a denial of service vulnerability...simply reboot the computer and carry on with your life. What if, however, the vulnerability actually allows an exhaustion of resources, which freezes the computer, which, in turn, causes the denial of service, and this occurs while your are running Windows Update, and the only solution is a hard reboot, and now the computer boots to a blue screen. Suddenly the seemingly innocuous denial of service vulnerability is not so innocuous.

					<li>The severity rating (e.g., low, moderate, important, and critical) and impact (e.g., denial of service, EOP, information disclosure, RCE, security feature bypass, or spoofing) of a Windows vulnerability does not matter. The only thing that matters is if the Windows vulnerability requires, or does not require, user interaction to be exploited.</li>
					<li>Toward securing a clean installation of Windows, this Web page assumes the worse, including:
						<ul>
							<li>Your network administrator and/or Internet Service Provider is not filtering, or is doing a poor job of filtering, malicious network traffic.</li>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_2"></a>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 8.1 Servicing Model</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_2_1"></a>1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 8.1 Servicing Model Ending September 2016: Individual Security Updates</p>

	<p>On the second Tuesday of each month (a.k.a., Patch Tuesday) through March 2017, Microsoft released a Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary consisting of one or more Microsoft Security Bulletins. A Microsoft Security Bulletin describes a single vulnerability, or group of related vulnerabilities, typically in a Microsoft product. Through September 2016, Microsoft Security Bulletins describing Windows vulnerabilities provided links to one or more Security Updates for Windows. A Security Update for Windows (a.k.a., a patch) is a single file. Upon installation, the Security Update(s) for a Microsoft Security Bulletin resolve (a.k.a, patch) the vulnerability(s) described in the Microsoft Security Bulletin.</p>

		<div class="note">
			<div class="noteMarker noteMarkerNormal">i</div>
			<div class="noteContent">Microsoft Security Bulletins are assigned an alpha-numeric name with syntax, MS##-###, where MS## is the year, and -### is the Microsoft Security Bulletin released that year. For example, MS10-001 is the first Microsoft Security Bulletin released in 2010.</div>
			<div class="clearBoth"></div>
		</div>

	<p>Security Updates for Windows can be installed in an automated, batch-like fashion via Windows Update. Security Updates for Windows can also be downloaded via the links in the Microsoft Security Bulletins and installed manually. To secure a clean installation of Windows 8.1 per this web page, it is necessary to install some Security Updates for Windows 8.1 before placing the computer online. This requires downloading and copying the Security Updates for Windows 8.1 to removable media before performing the clean installation of Windows 8.1.</p>

	<p>The Windows 8.1 servicing model starting October 2016: bundled updates and update rollups including security fixes by diagram (Source: <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsitpro/2016/10/07/more-on-windows-7-and-windows-8-1-servicing-changes/" class="linkContent">More On Windows 7 And Windows 8.1 Servicing Changes (blogs.technet.microsoft.com)</a>):</p>

	<p><img src="../images/windows_secure_installation/781_servicing_model_starting_Oct16/781_servicing_model_starting_Oct16.png" style="border:0;width:611px;height:355px" alt="Windows 8.1 Servicing Model Starting October 2016 By Diagram" class="img" /></p>

	<p>In the Windows 8.1 servicing model starting October 2016: 1.) a Security Monthly Quality Rollup (Monthly Rollup) for Windows 8.1 is a single file that contains new security fixes, and all previous security and non-security fixes for Windows 8.1 back through October 2016; and 2.) a Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollup (Preview Rollup) for Windows 8.1 is a single file that contains new non-security fixes, and all previous security and non-security fixes for Windows 8.1 back through October 2016. In other words, in the Windows 8.1 servicing model starting October 2016, Security Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 and Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 are cumulative back through October 2016. This means that to obtain the security fixes for Windows 8.1 from October 2016 through the present, it is only necessary to install the latest Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 or subsequent, not previous, Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1.</p>

	<p>Compared to the previous Windows 8.1 servicing model of individual Security Updates, the new Windows 8.1 servicing model of Security Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 and Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 are more similar to the Windows 10/11 servicing model of Cumulative Updates for Windows 10/11 in that the Security Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 and Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 are cumulative in nature; however, unlike the Cumulative Updates for Windows 10/11, which are cumulative back through the initial release of the version of Windows 10/11, the Security Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 and Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 are cumulative only back through October 2016.</p>

			<div class="noteContent">Microsoft intends to extend the cumulative aspect of the Security Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 and Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 back in time, presumably back to, not through, Windows 8.1 Update for Windows 8.1 (in the diagram above, see the Older fixes box at the bottom of February 02C KB15). Until Microsoft announces that such as occurred, and/or it can be independently demonstrated that such as occurred, to secure a clean installation of Windows 8.1 per this web page, it is necessary to play it safe and to maintain that the Security Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 and Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 8.1 are cumulative only back through October 2016.</div>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_3"></a>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 10/11 Servicing Model: Cumulative Updates</p>

	<p>Starting in November 2021, Microsoft intends to release a new version (a.k.a., feature update) of the supported versions of Windows 10/11 once a year in the second half of the year. On the second Tuesday of each month, Microsoft releases a Cumulative Update (a.k.a., quality update) for the supported versions of Windows 10/11. Microsoft intends to support each version of Windows 10 Home and Pro with Cumulative Updates for 18 months, and each version of Windows 11 Home and Pro with Cumulative Updates for 24 months:</p>

	<p>In the Windows 10/11 servicing model, a Cumulative Update for Windows 10/11 is a single file that contains new security and non-security fixes, and all previous security and non-security fixes (if there are any), for a version of Windows 10/11. In other words, in the Windows 10/11 servicing model, Cumulative Updates for Windows 10/11 are cumulative back through the initial release of the version of Windows 10/11. This means that to obtain the security (and non-security) fixes for Windows 10/11 from the initial release of the version of Windows 10/11 through the present, it is only necessary to install the latest Cumulative Update for Windows 10/11 for the version of Windows 10/11.</p>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_4"></a>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Servicing Stack Updates</p>

	<p>Servicing is the process of installing a Windows Service Pack, Update, Security Monthly Quality Rollup, Cumulative Update, Security Update, non-security update, fix, component, role, etc. Depending on what is being installed, servicing is performed manually by the user and/or automatically by Windows Update. The Servicing Stack is the component of Windows that performs servicing. Like other Windows components, the Servicing Stack is periodically updated. A Servicing Stack Update improves the speed and reliability of servicing.</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_4_1"></a>1.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting March 2021, Servicing Stack Updates For Windows 10 Version 2004 And Newer Are Included In The Cumulative Updates For Windows 10 Version 2004 And Newer</p>

	<p>Starting in March 2021, the Servicing Stack Updates for Windows 10 Version 2004 and newer are no longer released as standalone Updates. Instead, they are included in the Cumulative Updates for Windows 10 Version 2004 and newer. However, a special Servicing Stack Update for Windows 10 Version 2004, 20H2, and 21H1 (KB5005260) is a prerequisite for installing the latest Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 2004, 20H2, and 21H1. The special Servicing Stack Update Windows 10 Version 2004, 20H2, and 21H1 (KB5005260) is not prerequisite for installing the latest Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 21H2.</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_4_2"></a>1.4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Servicing Stack Updates For Windows 11 Are Included In The Cumulative Updates For Windows 11</p>

	<p>The Servicing Stack Updates for Windows 11 are included in the Cumulative Updates for Windows 11.</p>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_5"></a>1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying The Security Update Holes In Securing A Clean Installation Of Windows 8.1/10/11</p>

	<p>To secure a clean installation of Windows per this web page, it is necessary to resolve the known examples of Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited before placing the computer online. Therefore, to secure a clean installation of Windows 8.1, upon installing the Windows 8.1 operating system, Windows 8.1 Update, and the latest Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 or subsequent, not previous, Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1, it is necessary to identify any security update holes into which Security Updates for Windows 8.1 have not been installed. And to secure a clean installation of Windows 10/11, upon installing the Windows 10 operating system and the latest Cumulative Update for Windows 10/11, it is necessary to identify any security update holes into which Security Updates for Windows 10/11 have not been installed.</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_5_1"></a>1.5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Update Hole In Securing A Clean Installation Of Windows 8.1</p>

	<p>Windows 8.1 Update resolves all Windows 8.1 vulnerabilities (that do or do not require user interaction to be exploited) through April 08, 2014, which is through MS14-019. The latest Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 or subsequent, not previous, Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 resolves all Windows 8.1 vulnerabilities (that do or do not require user interaction to be exploited) from October 2016, which is from MS16-118, through the present. Therefore, after installing Windows 8.1 Update and the latest Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 or subsequent, not previous, Preview Of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1, there exists a security update hole from May 2014 through September 2016, which if from MS14-020 through MS16-117, into which no Security Updates for Windows 8.1 have been installed.</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_5_2"></a>1.5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;No Security Update Hole In Securing A Clean Installation Of Windows 10/11</p>

	<p>The latest Cumulative Update for a supported version of Windows 10/11 resolves all Windows 10/11 vulnerabilities (that do or do not require user interaction to be exploited) from the initial release of the version of Windows 10/11 through the present. Therefore, after installing the latest Cumulative Update for a supported version of Windows 10/11, there does not exist a security update hole into which no Security Updates for Windows 10/11 have been installed.</p>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_6"></a>1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Compiling The List Of Security Updates For Windows 8.1 That Resolve Vulnerabilities That Do Not Require User Interaction To Be Exploited</p>

	<p>After identifying the security update holes in securing a clean installation of Windows 8.1, the next steps are to list the Microsoft Security Bulletins for Windows 8.1, read the Microsoft Security Bulletins for Windows 8.1 that fall into the date range/Microsoft Security Bulletin number range of the security update holes in securing a clean installation of <a href="#toc1_5_1" class="linkContent">Windows 8.1 (above)</a>, determine if a Security Update for Windows 8.1 resolves a vulnerability that requires, or does not require, user interaction to be exploited, and to make the list of Security Updates for Windows 8.1 that resolve vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited:</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_6_1"></a>1.6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Listing And Reading The Microsoft Security Bulletins For Windows 8.1</p>

	<p>To list the Microsoft Security Bulletins for Windows 8.1:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Visit the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletins" class="linkListItem">Microsoft Security Updates (technet.microsoft.com)</a> web page.</li>
		<li>In the Filter bulletins by product or component dropdown, if you intend to install:
			<ul>
				<li>Windows 8.1 32-bit (edition does not matter), select Windows 8.1 for 32-bit systems.</li>
				<li>Windows 8.1 64-bit (edition does not matter), select Windows 8.1 for x64-based systems.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The Microsoft Security Bulletins for Windows 8.1 (32/64-bit) are listed.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>It is not necessary to read the entire list of Microsoft Security Bulletins for Windows 8.1. Instead, it is <em>only</em> necessary to read the Microsoft Security Bulletins for Windows 8.1 that fall into the date range/Microsoft Security Bulletin number range of the security update holes in securing a clean installation of <a href="#toc1_5_1" class="linkContent">Windows 8.1 (above)</a>.</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_6_2"></a>1.6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining That A Security Update For Windows Resolves A Vulnerability That Requires User Interaction To Be Exploited</p>

	<p>The language in Microsoft Security Bulletins makes it easy to determine if a vulnerability does not require user interaction to be exploited. If language similar to the following appears in a Microsoft Security Bulletin, the Security Update for Windows resolves a vulnerability that requires user interaction to be exploited.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><i>&quot;This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-035.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-053.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted media file or receive specially crafted streaming content from a Web site or any application that delivers Web content.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-062.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;An attacker could host a malicious Web site that hosts specially crafted media content that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through an internet browser and then convince a user to view the Web site and open the specially crafted media content.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-062.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-053.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, or by opening an attachment sent through e-mail.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-053.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted e-mail message to the user and convincing the user to preview or open the e-mail.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-064.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a link listed within an e-mail message.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-042.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;If a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-053.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-052.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted e-mail message containing an attachment to the user and by convincing the user to open the attachment. When the user attempts to open the attachment, an attacker specified malicious executable file could be run.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-045.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting up a malicious e-mail server and convincing the client to connect to this machine.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-030.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;An attacker could host a specially crafted server that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to initiate a connection with it.&quot;</i> - Adapted from Microsoft Security Bulletins MS10-020.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;This vulnerability requires that a user view a specially crafted file with an affected application.&quot;</i> - Adapted from Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-043.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;This vulnerability requires a user to open a specially crafted file for any malicious action to occur.&quot;</i> - Adapted from Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-033.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user, Windows feature, or application run or install a specially crafted file.&quot;</i> - Adapted from Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-019.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-059.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally or remotely to exploit this vulnerability.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-069.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over the affected system.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-059.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;By default, printers are not shared on any of the currently supported Windows operating systems. Systems are only vulnerable to remote attack when sharing a printer and the remote attacker can access the printer share.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-061.</li>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_6_3"></a>1.6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining That A Security Update For Windows Resolves A Vulnerability That Does Not Require User Interaction To Be Exploited</p>

	<p>The language in Microsoft Security Bulletins makes it difficult to determine if a vulnerability does not require user interaction to be exploited. If language similar to the following appears in a Microsoft Security Bulletin, the Security Update for Windows likely resolves a vulnerability that requires user interaction to be exploited.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><i>&quot;Any Windows system connected to a network or the Internet would be at risk.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-037.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;On Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 systems, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability without authentication to run arbitrary code. It is possible that this vulnerability could be used in the crafting of a wormable exploit.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-067.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;On Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 systems, any anonymous user with access to the target network could deliver a specially crafted network packet to the affected system in order to exploit this vulnerability.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-067.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted TCP/IP packets to a computer that has a service listening over the network.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-048.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;Only attackers on the local subnet would be able to exploit this vulnerability without interaction.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-063.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a program to send a sequence of specially crafted packets to a target system.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-031.</li>
		<li><i>&quot;To exploit the vulnerability, in most situations, an unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted packet to a targeted SMBv1 server.&quot;</i> - Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Final determination if a vulnerability does not require user interaction to be exploited often requires clicking the vulnerability's <a href="https://www.cve.mitre.org/images/cvebanner.gif" class="linkContent">Common Vulnerabilities And Exposures (CVE) (cve.mitre.org)</a> link, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" class="linkContent">National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (nvd.nist.gov)</a> link, and examining, for example, the Attack Vector (AV), Privileges Required (PR)/Authentication (AU), and User Interaction (UI) analysis data.</p>

	<p>If it is still unclear if a vulnerability does not require user interaction to be exploited, to secure a clean installation of Windows per this web page, it is necessary to play it safe and to include the Security Update for Windows in the list of Security Updates for Windows 8.1 that resolve vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited.</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_6_4"></a>1.6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy On Security Update For Windows Supersedence And On Adding All Of The Security Updates In A Microsoft Security Bulletin To The List</p>

	<p>Sometimes a Microsoft Security Bulletin consists of one Security Update for Windows. Sometimes a Microsoft Security Bulletin consists of multiple Security Updates for Windows. Sometimes a new Security Update for Windows replaces an old Security Update for Windows. And sometimes when a Microsoft Security Bulletin consists of multiple Security Updates for Windows, only some of the Security Updates for Windows resolve Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited.</p>

	<p>When a new Security Update for Windows replaces an old Security Update for Windows, it is said that the new Security Update for Windows supersedes (i.e., takes the place of/replaces) the old Security Update for Windows. Security Update for Windows supersedence information is presented in the Updates Replaced column of the Affected Software section of the Microsoft Security Bulletin.</p>

	<p>When an old Security Update for Windows is superseded by a new Security Update for Windows, it is not necessary to install both the old superseded and the new superseding Security Updates for Windows. Instead, it is only necessary to install the new superseding Security Update for Windows. If the old superseded Security Update for Windows is already installed, it is not necessary to uninstall it. Instead, leave the old superseded Security Update for Windows installed and simply install the new superseding Security Update for Windows. When finished, both the old superseded and the new superseding Security Updates for Windows are listed as being installed. In other words, there is nothing wrong with installing both the old superseded and the new superseding Security Updates for Windows except that it is extra work.</p>

	<p>Over time, the supersedence of Security Updates for Windows has become increasingly confounding. Moreover, there have been a couple of instances where the stated supersedence of Security Updates for Windows is questionable and/or appears to be incorrect. Rather than trying to decipher the correct supersedence of Security Updates for Windows, and unnecessarily driving oneself mad in the process, a simpler and safer policy has been adopted: ignore supersedence and list all of the Microsoft Security Bulletins that include Security Updates for Windows that resolve Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited.</p>

	<p>Lastly, when a Microsoft Security Bulletin consists of multiple Security Updates for Windows, and some of the Security Updates for Windows resolve Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited, and some of the Security Updates for Windows resolve Windows vulnerabilities that require user interaction to be exploited; rather than omitting the Security Updates for Windows that resolve Windows vulnerabilities that require user interaction to be exploited, and possibly having someone wonder if a mistake was made, a simpler and less confusing policy has been adopted: list all of the Security Updates for Windows included in a Microsoft Security Bulletin, including those that resolve Windows vulnerabilities that require user interaction to be exploited.</p>

	<p class="subsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_7"></a>1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview: How To Secure A Clean Installation Of Windows 8.1/10/11</p>

	<p>Toward securing Windows, it is instructive to divide Windows vulnerabilities into two groups: 1.) those that require user interaction to be exploited, and 2.) those that do not require user interaction to be exploited. The Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited must be resolved offline (i.e., before placing the computer online). For the Windows vulnerabilities that require user interaction to be exploited, provided the user has not interacted with the computer in any way that could result in compromise, they can be resolved by placing the computer online and running Windows Update. The following are overviews of how to secure a clean installation of Windows 8.1/10/11 per this web page.</p>

	<p class="subSubsectionTitle"><a id="toc1_7_1"></a>1.7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview: How To Secure A Clean Installation Of Windows 8.1</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Do the following offline, and before interacting with the computer in any way that could result in compromise:
			<ol>
				<li>Perform a default installation of Windows 8.1 onto a new or fully erased hard drive. The new or fully erased hard drive ensures the installation of Windows 8.1 is free from compromise (i.e., clean). The default installation of Windows 8.1 ensures a single, common baseline of started/stopped services from which the list of Security Updates for Windows 8.1 to install offline can be built. In other words, the default installation of Windows 8.1 ensures that no unexpected services are started/stopped as might influence the list of Security Updates for Windows 8.1 to install offline.</li>
				<li>Install Windows 8.1 Update. This resolves all Windows 8.1 vulnerabilities (that do or do not require user interaction to be exploited) through April 2014, which is through MS14-019.</li>
				<li>Install the Security Updates for Windows 8.1 from May 2014 through September 2016, which is from MS14-020 through MS16-117, that resolve Windows 8.1 vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited. Combined with the above, this resolves all Windows 8.1 vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited through September 2016, which is through MS16-117.</li>
				<li>Install the latest Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1. This resolves all Windows 8.1 vulnerabilities (that do or do not require user interaction to be exploited) from October 2016, which is from MS16-118, through the present. And, combined with the above, this resolves all Windows 8.1 vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited through the present.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Do the following online, and before interacting with the computer in any way that could result in compromise:
			<ul>
				<li>Run Windows Update and install any Security Updates for Windows 8.1. Combined with the above, this resolves all Windows 8.1 vulnerabilities that require user interaction to be exploited through the present.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

<div class="section">

	<p>To secure a clean installation of Windows per this web page, it is necessary to resolve the known examples of Windows vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction to be exploited before placing the computer online. This requires downloading and copying one or more files to removable media before performing the clean installation of Windows 8.1/10/11. Because files on CDs/DVDs are far more difficult manipulate by malicious software/users than files on external hard disk drives and flash memory drives, CDs/DVDs are the removable media of choice.</p>
